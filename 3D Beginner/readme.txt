Linear interpolation: When the player gets close to an enemy, the vignette
increases and decreases when the player moves away from the enemy. - Jacob Rammer 

Quaternion/Linear interpolation / Dot Product: When a player gets close to a ghost, 
the ghost stops moving and faces the player. The closer the player is to the ghost 
when the player moves (within the hearing radius), the faster the ghost turns around. - Tyler Christenson
